# 1.1 Functions and their graphs

$$y = f(x)$$
 y equals f of x.
 
The symbol $f$ represents the function, the letter $x$ is the independent variable representing the input value to $f$, and $y$ is the dependent variable or output value of $f$ at $x$.

A function f from a set $D$ to a set $Y$ is a rule that assigns a single value $f (x)$ in $Y$ to each $x$ in $D$.
The set $D$ of all possible input values is called the **domain** of the function. The set of all output values $f(x)$ as $x$ varies throughout $D$ is called the **range** of the function.
