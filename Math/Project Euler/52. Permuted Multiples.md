It can be seen that the number, $125874$, and its double, $251748$, contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order.

Find the smallest positive integer, $x$, such that $2x$, $3x$, $4x$, $5x$, and $6x$, contain the same digits.

Answer: 142857

```python
for expo in range(1, 10):
    start = 10 ** expo
    end = start + 7 * 10 ** (expo - 1)

    for x in range(start, end):
        digits = sorted([c for c in str(x)])
        flag = True
        for t in range(2, 7):
            d = sorted([c for c in str(x * t)])
            if d != digits:
                flag = False
                break
        if flag:
            print(x)
            exit(0)
```
