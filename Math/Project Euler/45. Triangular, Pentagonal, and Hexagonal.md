Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle    $T_n=n(n+1)/2$   $1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \dots$
Pentagonal  $P_n=n(3n - 1)/2$  $1, 5, 12, 22, 35, \dots$
Hexagonal   $H_n=n(2n - 1)$   $1, 6, 15, 28, 45, \dots$

It can be verified that $T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755$.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

From
$$ {a(a+1) \over 2} = {b(3b-1) \over 2} = {c(2c-1)}$$ 
We have $$ a = 2c-1, \space 2c(2c-1)=b(3b-1) $$
```python
from math import floor, sqrt

for c in range(144, 100000):
    t = 2 * c * (2 * c - 1)
    dt = 12 * t + 1
    st = floor(sqrt(dt))
    if st ** 2 == dt and (st + 1) % 6 == 0:
        b = (st + 1) // 6
        print(b * (3 * b - 1) // 2)
```
