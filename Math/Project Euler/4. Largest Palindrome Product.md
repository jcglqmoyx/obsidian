A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two $2$-digit numbers is $9009 = 91 \times 99$.  
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two $3$-digit numbers.

Answer:Â 906609

---
```python
res = 0
for a in range(999, 99, -1):
    if a * a < res:
        break
    for b in range(a, 99, -1):
        p = a * b
        s = str(p)
        if s[::-1] == s:
            res = max(res, p)
print(res)
```

Optimization:
```python
largestPalindrome = 0
a = 999
while a >= 100:
    if a % 11 == 0:
        b = 999
        db = 1
    else:
        b = 990
        db = 11
    while b >= a:
        p = a * b
        if p <= largestPalindrome:
            break
        s = str(p)
        if s == s[::-1]:
            largestPalindrome = p
        b -= db
    a -= 1
print(largestPalindrome)
```
