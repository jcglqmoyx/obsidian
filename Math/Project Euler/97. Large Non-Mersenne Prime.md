The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form $2^{6972593} - 1$; it contains exactly $2\,098\,960$ digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form $2^p - 1$, have been found which contain more digits.

However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains $2\,357\,207$ digits: $28433 \times 2^{7830457} + 1$.

Find the last ten digits of this prime number.

Answer: 8739992577

```python
MOD = 10 ** 10


def power(x: int, n: int) -> int:
    p = 1
    while n:
        if n & 1:
            p = p * x % MOD
        x = x * x % MOD
        n >>= 1
    return p


res = (power(2, 7830457) * 28433 + 1) % MOD
res = str(res)
if len(res) < 10:
    res = '0' * (10 - len(res)) + res
print(res)
```
