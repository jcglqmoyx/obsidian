There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:
$$123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, 345$$
In combinatorics, we use the notation, $\displaystyle \binom 5 3 = 10$.
In general, $\displaystyle \binom n r = \dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $r \le n$, $n! = n \times (n-1) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$, and $0! = 1$.

It is not until $n = 23$, that a value exceeds one-million: $\displaystyle \binom {23} {10} = 1144066$.
How many, not necessarily distinct, values of $\displaystyle \binom n r$ for $1 \le n \le 100$, are greater than one-million?

Answer: 4075

```python
n, limit = 100, 1_000_000  
f = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]  
cnt = 0  
for i in range(n + 1):  
    for j in range(i + 1):  
        if j == 0:  
            f[i][j] = 1  
        else:  
            f[i][j] = f[i - 1][j - 1] + f[i - 1][j]  
        if f[i][j] > limit:  
            cnt += 1  
  
print(cnt)
```
