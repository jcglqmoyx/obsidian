By listing the first six prime numbers: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11$, and $13$, we can see that the $6$th prime is $13$.
What is the $10\,001$st prime number?

Answer: 104743

```python
n = 110000
st = [False] * n
primes = []
for i in range(2, n):
    if not st[i]:
        primes.append(i)
        if len(primes) == 10001:
            print(primes[-1])
            break
    j = 0
    while primes[j] * i < n:
        st[primes[j] * i] = True
        if i % primes[j] == 0:
            break
        j += 1
```
