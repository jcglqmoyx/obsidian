It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

$9 = 7 + 2 \times 1^2$
$15 = 7 + 2 \times 2^2$
$21 = 3 + 2 \times 3^2$
$25 = 7 + 2 \times 3^2$
$27 = 19 + 2 \times 2^2$
$33 = 31 + 2 \times 1^2$

It turns out that the conjecture was false.
What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?

Answer:  5777

```python
from math import *

N = 10000
st = [False] * N
primes = []
for i in range(2, N):
    if not st[i]:
        primes.append(i)
    j = 0
    while primes[j] * i < N:
        st[primes[j] * i] = True
        if i % primes[j] == 0:
            break
        j += 1
v = []
for i in range(1, ceil(sqrt(N))):
    v.append(2 * i * i)

for i in range(9, N, 2):
    if st[i]:
        flag = True
        j = 1
        for s in v:
            if s >= i:
                break
            if not st[i - s]:
                flag = False
        if flag:
            print(i)
            exit(0)
```
