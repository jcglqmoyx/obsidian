Consider all integer combinations of $a^b$ for $2 \le a \le 5$ and $2 \le b \le 5$:

$$ 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32 $$
$$ 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243 $$
$$ 4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024 $$
$$ 5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125 $$

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of $15$ distinct terms:
$$4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125.$$
How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by $a^b$ for $2 \le a \le 100$ and $2 \le b \le 100$?

Answer: 9183

```python
n = 100  
dump = [False] * (n + 1)  
count = 0  
  
for a in range(2, n + 1):  
    if not dump[a]:  
        s = set()  
        b = 2  
        while a ** b <= n:  
            dump[a ** b] = True  
            for x in range(n // b * b + b, b * (n + 1), b):  
                s.add(x)  
            b += 1  
        count += n - 1 + len(s)  
print(count)
```
