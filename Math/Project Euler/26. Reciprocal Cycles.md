A unit fraction contains $1$ in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators $2$ to $10$ are given:
```
1/2 = 0.5
1/3 =0.(3)
1/4 =0.25
1/5 = 0.2
1/6 = 0.1(6)
1/7 = 0.(142857)
1/8 = 0.125
1/9 = 0.(1)
1/10 = 0.1
```
Where $0.1(6)$ means $0.166666\cdots$, and has a $1$-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that $1/7$ has a $6$-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of $d \lt 1000$ for which $1/d$ contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

Answer: 983

```python
res = 0  
max_len = 0  
for i in range(1, 1000):  
    a = 1  
    cycle = 0  
    has_recurring_cycle = True  
    S = set()  
    while a < i:  
        a *= 10  
        if a in S:  
            break  
        S.add(a)  
        a %= i  
        if a == 0:  
            has_recurring_cycle = False  
            break        cycle += 1  
    if has_recurring_cycle:  
        if cycle > max_len:  
            max_len = cycle  
            res = i  
print(res)
```
