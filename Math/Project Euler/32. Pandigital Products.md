We shall say that an $n$-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits $1$ to $n$ exactly once; for example, the $5$-digit number, $15234$, is $1$ through $5$ pandigital.

The product $7254$ is unusual, as the identity, $39 \times 186 = 7254$, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is $1$ through $9$ pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a $1$ through $9$ pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

```python
from itertools import permutations

n = 9

d = [x for x in range(1, n + 1)]

S = set()
s = 0
for v in permutations(d, n):
    u = (n + 1) // 2
    p = 0
    for i in range(u, n):
        p = p * 10 + v[i]
    a, b = 0, 0
    for i in range(u):
        b = b * 10 + v[i]
    base = 10 ** (u - 1)
    for i in range(u - 1):
        a = a * 10 + v[i]
        b -= v[i] * base
        if a > b:
            break
        base //= 10
        if a * b == p and p not in S:
            s += p
            S.add(p)

print(s)
```
