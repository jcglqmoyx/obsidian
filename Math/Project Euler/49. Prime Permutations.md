The arithmetic sequence, $1487, 4817, 8147$, in which each of the terms increases by $3330$, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are prime, and, (ii) each of the $4$-digit numbers are permutations of one another.

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three $1$-, $2$-, or $3$-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other $4$-digit increasing sequence.

What $12$-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?

```python
N = 10000  
st = [False] * N  
pm = []  
  
for i in range(2, N):  
    if not st[i]:  
        pm.append(i)  
    j = 0  
    while pm[j] * i < N:  
        st[pm[j] * i] = True  
        if i % pm[j] == 0:  
            break  
        j += 1  
s = set(pm)  
for x in pm:  
    if x < 1000:  
        continue  
    digits = [int(c) for c in str(x)]  
    digits.sort()  
  
  
    def dfs(u, num, mask):  
        global x  
        if u == len(digits):  
            if num < x and num in s and digits == sorted([int(c) for c in str(num)]):  
                diff = x - num  
                if x + diff in s and digits == sorted([int(x) for x in str(x + diff)]):  
                    print('%d%d%d' % (num, x, x + diff))  
        else:  
            for i in range(len(digits)):  
                if mask >> i & 1 or (i and digits[i] == digits[i - 1] and mask >> (i - 1) & 1):  
                    continue  
                mask ^= 1 << i  
                dfs(u + 1, num * 10 + digits[i], mask)  
                mask ^= 1 << i  
  
  
    dfs(0, 0, 0)
