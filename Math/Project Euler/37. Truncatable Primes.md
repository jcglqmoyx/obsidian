The number $3797$ has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: $3797$, $797$, $97$, and $7$. Similarly we can work from right to left: $3797$, $379$, $37$, and $3$.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

**NOTE**: $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$ are not considered to be truncatable primes.

Answer: 748317

```python
N = 10 ** 6
st = [False] * (N + 1)
st[0] = st[1] = True
primes = []
for i in range(2, N + 1):
    if not st[i]:
        primes.append(i)
    j = 0
    while primes[j] * i <= N:
        st[primes[j] * i] = True
        if i % primes[j] == 0:
            break
        j += 1

sum = 0
for p in primes:
    if p < 10:
        continue
    s = str(p)
    n = len(s)
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if st[int(s[i:])] or st[int(s[:i])]:
            flag = False
            break
    if flag:
        sum += p
print(sum)
```
