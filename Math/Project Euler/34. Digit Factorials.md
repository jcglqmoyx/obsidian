$145$ is a curious number, as $1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145$.  

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.  

**Note**: As $1! = 1$ and $2! = 2$ are not sums they are not included.

Answer: 40730

```python
f = [1] * 10  
for i in range(2, 10):  
    f[i] = f[i - 1] * i  
res = 0  
for i in range(10, 10 ** 5):  
    if i == sum(f[int(x)] for x in str(i)):  
        res += i  
print(res)
```
