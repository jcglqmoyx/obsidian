The $n$<sup>th</sup> term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, $t_n = \frac12n(n+1)$; so the first ten triangle numbers are:
$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \dots$$

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is $19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_{10}$. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using [words.txt](https://projecteuler.net/resources/documents/0042_words.txt), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?

Answer: 162

```python
from math import floor, sqrt

words = [w[1:-1] for w in open('./0042_words.txt', 'r').readlines()[0].split(',')]
cnt = 0
for w in words:
    s = 0
    for c in w:
        s += ord(c) - ord('A') + 1
    dt = s * 8 + 1
    st = floor(sqrt(dt))
    if st * st == dt and (st - 1) % 2 == 0:
        cnt += 1
print(cnt)
```
