By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.
```
3
7 4
2 4 6
8 5 9 3
```

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
Find the maximum total from top to bottom in [triangle.txt](https://resources/documents/0067_triangle.txt), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

Answer: 7273

```python
lines = open('./0067_triangle.txt', 'r').readlines()
f = []
for i in range(1, len(lines) + 1):
    v = [int(x) for x in lines[i - 1].split()]
    if not f:
        f = v
    else:
        g = [f[0] + v[0]] + [0] * (i - 2) + [f[-1] + v[-1]]
        for i in range(1, i - 1):
            g[i] = max(f[i - 1], f[i]) + v[i]
        f = g
print(max(f))
```
