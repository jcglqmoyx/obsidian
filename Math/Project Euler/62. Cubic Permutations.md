The cube, $41063625$ ($345^3$), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: $56623104$ ($384^3$) and $66430125$ ($405^3$). In fact, $41063625$ is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.

Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.

```python
from collections import *

n, k = 10 ** 4, 5  
  
cnt = defaultdict(list)  
for i in range(100, n):  
    p = i ** 3  
    digits = sorted([int(x) for x in str(p)])  
    cnt[str(digits)].append(p)  
  
for k, v in cnt.items():  
    if len(v) == 5:  
        print(v[0])  
        break
```
