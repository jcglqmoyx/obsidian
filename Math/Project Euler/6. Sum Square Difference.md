The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12+22+...+102\=385.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1+2+...+10)2\=552\=3025.

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025−385\=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

```python
limit = 100
sum = limit * (limit + 1) // 2
sum_sq = (2 * limit + 1) * (limit + 1) * limit // 6
print(sum * sum - sum_sq)
```
