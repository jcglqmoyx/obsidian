In the 5 by 5 matrix below, the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right, by **only moving to the right and down**, is indicated in bold red and is equal to 2427.

(131673234103182019634296515063080374642211153769949712195680573252437331)

Find the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right by only moving right and down in [matrix.txt](https://projecteuler.net/resources/documents/0081_matrix.txt) (right click and "Save Link/Target As..."), a 31K text file containing an 80 by 80 matrix.

```python
lines = open('./0081_matrix.txt', 'r').readlines()
v, f = [], []
for line in lines:
    v = [int(x) for x in line.split(',')]
    if not f:
        f = [v[0]] + [0] * (len(v) - 1)
        for i in range(1, len(v)):
            f[i] = f[i - 1] + v[i]
    else:
        g = [f[0] + v[0]] + [0] * (len(v) - 1)
        for i in range(1, len(v)):
            g[i] = min(f[i], g[i - 1]) + v[i]
        f = g
print(f[-1])
