Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, $P_n=n(3n-1)/2$. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
$$1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, \dots$$
It can be seen that $P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8$. However, their difference, $70 - 22 = 48$, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, $P_j$ and $P_k$, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and $D = |P_k - P_j|$ is minimised; what is the value of $D$?

```python
v = []  
for i in range(1, 2500):  
    v.append(i * (3 * i - 1) // 2)  
s = set(v)  
res = 10 ** 9  
for i in range(1, len(v)):  
    for j in range(i + 1, len(v)):  
        diff, sum = v[j] - v[i], v[i] + v[j]  
        if diff in s and sum in s:  
            res = min(res, diff)  
print(res)
```
