The minimal path sum in the $5$ by $5$ matrix below, by starting in any cell in the left column and finishing in any cell in the right column, and only moving up, down, and right, is indicated in red and bold; the sum is equal to $994$.
```
131 673 234 103 18
201 96 342 965 150
630 803 746 422 111
537 699 497 121 956
805 732 524 37 331
```
Find the minimal path sum from the left column to the right column in [matrix.txt](https://resources/documents/0082_matrix.txt), a 31K text file containing an $80$ by $80$ matrix.

```python
import heapq

lines = open('./0082_matrix.txt', 'r').readlines()
grid = []
for line in lines:
    grid.append([int(x) for x in line.split(',')])
n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])

ne = [[-1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]]
f = [1000000] * (n * m + 1)
st = [False] * (n * m + 1)
g = [[] for _ in range(n * m + 1)]

for i in range(n):
    g[n * m].append((i * m, grid[i][0]))
    for j in range(m):
        for d in range(len(ne)):
            x, y = i + ne[d][0], j + ne[d][1]
            if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m:
                g[i * m + j].append((x * m + y, grid[x][y]))

f[n * m] = 0
q = [(0, n * m)]
while q:
    length, v = heapq.heappop(q)
    if not st[v]:
        st[v] = True
        for e in g[v]:
            point, dist = e
            if f[point] > length + dist:
                f[point] = length + dist
                heapq.heappush(q, (f[point], point))
print(min([f[i * m + m - 1] for i in range(n)]))
