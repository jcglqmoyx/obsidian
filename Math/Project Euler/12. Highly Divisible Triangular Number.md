The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the $7$<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$. The first ten terms would be:
$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, dots$$

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

```
 1 1
 3 1,3
 6 1,2,3,6
10 1,2,5,10
15 1,3,5,15
21 1,3,7,21
28 1,2,4,7,14,28
```

We can see that $28$ is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
