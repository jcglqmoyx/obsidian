NOTE: This problem is a significantly more challenging version of [Problem 81](https://projecteuler.net/problem=81).

In the by matrix below, the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right, by moving left, right, up, and down, is indicated in bold red and is equal to .

Find the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right by moving left, right, up, and down in [matrix.txt](https://projecteuler.net/resources/documents/0083_matrix.txt) (right click and "Save Link/Target As..."), a 31K text file containing an by matrix.

```python
import heapq

lines = open('./0083_matrix.txt', 'r').readlines()
grid = []
for line in lines:
    grid.append([int(x) for x in line.split(',')])
n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])

ne = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]]
f = [1590000] * (n * m)
st = [False] * (n * m)
g = [[] for _ in range(n * m)]

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        for d in range(len(ne)):
            x, y = i + ne[d][0], j + ne[d][1]
            if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m:
                g[i * m + j].append((x * m + y, grid[x][y]))

f[0] = grid[0][0]
q = [(f[0], 0)]
while q:
    length, v = heapq.heappop(q)
    if not st[v]:
        st[v] = True
        for e in g[v]:
            point, dist = e
            if f[point] > length + dist:
                f[point] = length + dist
                heapq.heappush(q, (f[point], point))
                if point == n * m - 1:
                    print(f[point])
                    exit(0)
