Starting with $1$ and spiraling anti-clockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length $7$ is formed.

```
37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30
39 18  5  4  3 12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20  7  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
43 44 45 46 47 48 49
```

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that $8$ out of the $13$ numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of $8/13 \approx 62\%$.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length $9$ will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below $10\%$?

Answer: 26241

    if n < 3 or n % 2 == 0:  
        return n == 2  
    u, t = n - 1, 0  
    while u % 2 == 0:  
        u = u // 2  
        t = t + 1  
    for i in range(8):  
        a = randint(2, n - 1)  
        v = pow(a, u, n)

                break  
            v = v * v % n  
            s = s + 1

            cnt_prime += 1  
    tot += 4  
    if cnt_prime / tot < 0.1:  
        print(side_length + 1)  
        break  
    num += side_length * 4 + 2  
    side_length += 2
