By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid measuring $3$ by $2$ contains eighteen rectangles:

Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains exactly two million rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.

Answer: 2772

**With some analysis, we can figure out that there are ${n\times(n+1)\times m\times(m+1)}\over4$ rectangles in a $n * m$ rectangular grid.**
```python
from math import *

N = 21 * 10 ** 5
f = [0] * N
for m in range(1, int(sqrt(N)) * 2):
    for n in range(1, m + 1):
        cnt = m * (m + 1) * n * (n + 1) // 4
        if cnt < N:
            f[cnt] = max(f[cnt], n * m)
        else:
            break
q = 2 * 10 ** 6
res = 0
dist = 10 ** 10
for i in range(q, N):
    if f[i]:
        dist = i - q
        res = f[i]
        break
for i in range(q - 1, 0, -1):
    if f[i]:
        if q - i < dist or q - i == dist and f[i] > res:
            res = f[i]
        break
print(res)
```
