A googol ($10^{100}$) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; $100^{100}$ is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only $1$.
Considering natural numbers of the form, $a^b$, where $a, b \lt 100$, what is the maximum digital sum?

Answer: 972

```python
n = 100
res = 0
for a in range(1, n):
    for b in range(1, n):
        res = max(res, sum([int(x) for x in str(a ** b)]))
print(res)
```
