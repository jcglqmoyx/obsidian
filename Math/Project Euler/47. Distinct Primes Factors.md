The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:
$$14 = 2 \times 7$$
$$15 = 3 \times 5$$
The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:
$$644 = 2^2 \times 7 \times 23$$
$$645 = 3 \times 5 \times 43$$
$$646 = 2 \times 17 \times 19$$

```python
N = 2 * 10 ** 5  
  
st = [False] * N  
pm = []  
  
for i in range(2, N):  
    if not st[i]:  
        pm.append(i)  
    j = 0  
    while pm[j] * i < N:  
        st[pm[j] * i] = True  
        if i % pm[j] == 0:  
            break  
        j += 1  
  
f = [0] * N  
for p in pm:  
    x = p  
    while x < N:  
        f[x] += 1  
        x += p  
  
for i in range(2 * 3 * 5 * 7, N):  
    if f[i] == f[i + 1] == f[i + 2] == f[i + 3] == 4:  
        print(i)  
        break
```
