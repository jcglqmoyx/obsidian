If $p$ is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, $\{a, b, c\}$, there are exactly three solutions for $p = 120$.

$$\{20,48,52\}, \{24,45,51\}, \{30,40,50\}$$

For which value of $p \le 1000$, is the number of solutions maximised?

Answer: 840

```python
from math import gcd, sqrt, ceil  
  
N = 1000  
f = [0] * (N + 1)  
  
for n in range(1, ceil(sqrt(N + 1)), 2):  
    for m in range(n + 2, ceil(sqrt(N + 1)), 2):  
        if gcd(m, n) == 1:  
            k = m * (m + n)  
            while k <= N:  
                f[k] += 1  
                k += m * (m + n)  
mx = 0  
res = 0  
for i in range(1, N + 1):  
    if f[i] > mx:  
        mx = f[i]  
        res = i  
print(res)
```
