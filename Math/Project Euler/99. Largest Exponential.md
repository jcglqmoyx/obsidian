Comparing two numbers written in index form like $2^{11}$ and $3^7$ is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that $2^{11} = 2048 \lt 3^7 = 2187$.

However, confirming that $632382^{518061} \gt 519432^{525806}$ would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using [base_exp.txt](https://projecteuler.net/resources/documents/0099_base_exp.txt), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.

**NOTE**: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.

Answer: 709

```python
from math import log2

lines = open('./0099_base_exp.txt', 'r').readlines()
v = []
for i in range(1, len(lines) + 1):
    v.append([int(x) for x in lines[i - 1].split(',')] + [i])
v.sort(key=lambda e: e[1] * log2(e[0]))
print(v[-1][2])
```
