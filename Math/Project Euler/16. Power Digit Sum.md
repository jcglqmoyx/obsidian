$2^{15} = 32768$ and the sum of its digits is $3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26$.
What is the sum of the digits of the number $2^{1000}$?

Answer:  1366

Using Python's built-in function:
```python
print(sum([int(x) for x in str(1 << 1000)]))
```

Using fast exponentiation:
```python
def power(a, n):
    res = 1
    while n:
        if n & 1:
            res = res * a
        a *= a
        n >>= 1
    return res


n = 1000
print(sum([int(x) for x in str(power(2, n))]))
```
