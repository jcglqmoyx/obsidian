Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,…

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```py
a, b = 1, 2
res = 0
while b <= 4000000:
    if b % 2 == 0:
        res += b
    t = a + b
    a = b
    b = t
print(res)
```

Optimization:
```python
a, b = 2, 8
res = 2
while b <= 4000000:
    res += b
    c = 4 * b + a
    a = b
    b = c

print(res)
```
