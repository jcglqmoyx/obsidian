Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:
$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Answer: 4613732

```py
a, b = 1, 2
res = 0
while b <= 4000000:
    if b % 2 == 0:
        res += b
    t = a + b
    a = b
    b = t
print(res)
```

Optimization:
```python
a, b = 2, 8
res = 2
while b <= 4000000:
    res += b
    c = 4 * b + a
    a = b
    b = c

print(res)
```
