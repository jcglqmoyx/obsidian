In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:
<blockquote>1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).</blockquote>
It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
<blockquote>1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p</blockquote>
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

```python
n = 200  
v = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200]  
f = [1] + [0] * n  
for x in v:  
    for i in range(x, n + 1):  
        f[i] += f[i - x]  
print(f[n])
```
