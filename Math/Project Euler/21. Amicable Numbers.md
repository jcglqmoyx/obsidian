Let $d(n)$ be defined as the sum of proper divisors of $n$ (numbers less than $n$ which divide evenly into $n$).
If $d(a) = b$ and $d(b) = a$, where $a \ne b$, then $a$ and $b$ are an amicable pair and each of $a$ and $b$ are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of $220$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55$ and $110$; therefore $d(220) = 284$. The proper divisors of $284$ are $1, 2, 4, 71$ and $142$; so $d(284) = 220$.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under $10000$.

Answer: 31626

```python
N = 10000
d = [0] * N
for i in range(2, N):
    f = 1
    while f * f <= i:
        if i % f == 0:
            d[i] += f
            if f * f != i and f != 1:
                d[i] += i // f
        f += 1

s = 0
for i in range(1, N):
    if d[i] < N and d[d[i]] == i and d[i] != i:
        s += i
        print(i)
print(s)
```
