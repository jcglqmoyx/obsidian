Take the number $192$ and multiply it by each of $1$, $2$, and $3$:
$$ 192 \times 1 = 192 $$
$$ 192 \times 2 = 384 $$
$$ 192 \times 3 = 576 $$

By concatenating each product we get the $1$ to $9$ pandigital, $192384576$. We will call $192384576$ the concatenated product of $192$ and $(1,2,3)$.

The same can be achieved by starting with $9$ and multiplying by $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$, giving the pandigital, $918273645$, which is the concatenated product of $9$ and $(1,2,3,4,5)$.

What is the largest $1$ to $9$ pandigital $9$-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with $(1,2, \dots, n)$ where $n \gt 1$?

Answer: 932718654

```python
n, k = 10 ** 5, 9  
  
digits = set([x for x in range(1, 10)])  
res = 0  
for i in range(1, n):  
    s = ''  
    for j in range(1, k + 1):  
        s += str(i * j)  
        if len(s) > k:  
            break  
        if len(s) == k and set([int(c) for c in s]) == digits:  
            res = max(res, int(s))  
print(res)
```
