```c
#include <stdio.h>  
  
int main() {  
    printf("hello, world\n");  
    return 0;  
}
```

The representation of hello.c illustrates a fundamental idea: All information in a system is represented as a bunch of bits. The only thing that distinguishes different data objects is the context in which we view them. For example, in different contexts, the same sequence of bytes might represent an integer, floating-point number, character string, or machine instruction.
