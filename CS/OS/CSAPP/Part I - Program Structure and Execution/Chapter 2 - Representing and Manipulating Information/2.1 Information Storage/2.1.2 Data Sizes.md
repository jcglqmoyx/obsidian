Every computer has a `word size`, indicating the nominal size of pointer data. Since a virtual address is encoded by such a word, the most important system parameter determined by the word size is the maximum size of the virtual address space. That is, for a machine with a w-bit word size, the virtual addresses can range from 0 to $2^w − 1$, giving the program access to at most $2^w$ bytes.

In recent years, there has been a widespread shift from machines with 32-bit word sizes to those with word sizes of 64 bits. This occurred first for high-end machines designed for large-scale scientific and database applications, followed by desktop and laptop machines, and most recently for the processors found in smartphones. A 32-bit word size limits the virtual address space to 4 gigabytes (written 4 GB), that is, just over $4 × 10^9$ bytes. Scaling up to a 64-bit word size leads to a virtual address space of 16 `exabytes`, or around $1.84 × 10^{19}$ bytes.
