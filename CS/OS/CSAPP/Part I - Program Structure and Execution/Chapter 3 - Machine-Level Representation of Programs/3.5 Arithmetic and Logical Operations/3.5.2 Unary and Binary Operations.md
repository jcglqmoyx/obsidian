#### Unary Operations:
- Unary operations have a **single operand** serving as both the source and destination.
- The operand can be either a register or a memory location.
- **Example**:
  - `incq (%rsp)` increments the 8-byte element at the top of the stack.
- This syntax is reminiscent of the C increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators.

---
#### Binary Operations:
- Binary operations involve two operands:
  1. The **second operand** serves as both the source and the destination.
  2. The **first operand** provides the value for the operation.
- Syntax resembles the C assignment operators, such as `x -= y`.
- **Noncommutative Nature**:
  - The source operand is listed **first**, and the destination operand is listed **second**.
  - **Example**:
    - `subq %rax, %rdx`:
      - Subtracts `%rax` from `%rdx` and stores the result in `%rdx`.
      - Can be read as: “Subtract `%rax` from `%rdx`.”

#### Operand Rules:
- The **first operand** can be:
  - An immediate value
  - A register
  - A memory location
- The **second operand** can be:
  - A register
  - A memory location

#### Restrictions:
- Both operands **cannot** be memory locations.
- If the **second operand** is a memory location:
  - The processor must:
    1. Read the value from memory.
    2. Perform the operation.
    3. Write the result back to memory.
