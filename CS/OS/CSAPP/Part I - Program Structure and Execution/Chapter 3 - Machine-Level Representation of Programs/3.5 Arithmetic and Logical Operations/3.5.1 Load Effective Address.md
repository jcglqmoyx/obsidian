### `leaq` Instruction: Load Effective Address

- The **load effective address** instruction `leaq` is a variant of the `movq` instruction.
- **Purpose**:
  - Reads from memory to a register.
  - Copies the **effective address** to the destination register without referencing memory.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **First Operand**:
  - Appears as a memory reference but does not access the designated memory location.
  - Instead, it calculates and stores the effective address in the destination.

- **Computation Representation**:
  - Using the C address operator `&`.

#### Uses:
1. **Pointer Arithmetic**:
   - Generates pointers for future memory references.
2. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Compacts common arithmetic operations.
   - Example:
     - If `%rdx` contains value `x`, then:
       ```
       leaq 7(%rdx, %rdx, 4), %rax
       ```
       - This sets `%rax` to `5x + 7`.

3. **Compiler Optimization**:
   - Efficiently calculates effective addresses for operations unrelated to memory addressing.

#### Restrictions:
- The **destination operand** must be a register.
