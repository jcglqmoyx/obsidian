The source operand of a move instruction designates a value that is immediate, stored in a register, or stored in memory. The destination operand designates a location that is either a register or a memory address. x86-64 imposes the restriction that a move instruction cannot have both operands refer to memory locations. Copying a value from one memory location to another requires two instructionsâ€”the first to load the source value into a register, and the second to write this register value to the destination.

For most cases, the `mov` instructions will only update the specific register bytes or memory locations indicated by the destination operand. The only exception is that when `movl` has a register as the destination, it will also set the high-order 4 bytes of the register to 0. This exception arises from the convention, adopted in x86-64, that any instruction that generates a 32-bit value for a register also sets the high-order portion of the register to 0.

### Notes on `movq` and `movabsq` Instructions

- **`movq` Instruction**:
  - Can only have immediate source operands represented as **32-bit two's-complement numbers**.
  - The value is **sign-extended** to produce the 64-bit value for the destination.

- **`movabsq` Instruction**:
  - Can handle an **arbitrary 64-bit immediate value** as its source operand.
  - The destination can **only be a register**.




### Understanding How Data Movement Changes a Destination Register

#### Key Concepts:
- Data movement instructions in assembly have different conventions on how they modify the **upper bytes** of a destination register.
- Example sequence demonstrating these conventions:

```asm
1. movabsq $0x0011223344556677, %rax  # %rax = 0011223344556677
2. movb    $-1, %al                   # %rax = 00112233445566FF
3. movw    $-1, %ax                   # %rax = 001122334455FFFF
4. movl    $-1, %eax                  # %rax = 00000000FFFFFFFF
5. movq    $-1, %rax                  # %rax = FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
```



### Understanding How Data Movement Changes a Destination Register

#### Key Concepts:
- Data movement instructions in assembly have different conventions on how they modify the **upper bytes** of a destination register.
- Example sequence demonstrating these conventions:

```asm
1. movabsq $0x0011223344556677, %rax    # %rax = 0011223344556677
2. movb    $-1, %al                     # %rax = 00112233445566FF
3. movw    $-1, %ax                     # %rax = 001122334455FFFF
4. movl    $-1, %eax                    # %rax = 00000000FFFFFFFF
5. movq    $-1, %rax                    # %rax = FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
```
#### Explanation:
- **Hexadecimal Representation**:
  - The value `-1` is represented in hexadecimal as `FF...F` (with twice as many `F`s as the number of bytes).
- **Instruction Effects**:
  1. **`movabsq`**:
     - Initializes `%rax` with `0011223344556677`.
  2. **`movb`**:
     - Sets the low-order byte of `%rax` (`%al`) to `FF`, leaving other bytes unchanged.
  3. **`movw`**:
     - Sets the low-order 2 bytes (`%ax`) to `FFFF`, leaving the higher bytes unchanged.
  4. **`movl`**:
     - Sets the low-order 4 bytes (`%eax`) to `FFFFFFFF`, and clears the upper 4 bytes to `00000000`.
  5. **`movq`**:
     - Sets the entire `%rax` register to `FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`.
#### Summary:
- The lower bytes of the register are updated as specified by the data size (`byte`, `word`, `long`, `quad`).
- Higher bytes may remain unchanged, cleared to `0`, or set entirely depending on the instruction.





### Understanding `movz` and `movs` Instructions

- **`movz` Class**:
  - Fills the **remaining bytes** of the destination with **zeros**.

- **`movs` Class**:
  - Fills the **remaining bytes** of the destination by **sign extension**, replicating copies of the **most significant bit** of the source operand.

- **Instruction Naming Convention**:
  - Each instruction name includes **size designators** in its final two characters:
    - The **first character** specifies the **source size**.
    - The **second character** specifies the **destination size**.

- **Available Instructions**:
  - Three instructions exist in each class (`movz` and `movs`), covering:
    - **1-byte** and **2-byte source sizes**.
    - **2-byte** and **4-byte destination sizes**.
  - These instructions are applicable only in cases where the **destination size is larger than the source size**.


### Zero-Extension and Sign-Extension in Data Movement

- **4-Byte to 8-Byte Zero-Extension**:
  - There is no explicit instruction to zero-extend a 4-byte source value to an 8-byte destination (e.g., a hypothetical `movz1q` instruction).
  - Instead, this can be achieved using the `movl` instruction with a register as the destination, which automatically fills the upper 4 bytes of the destination register with zeros.

- **Sign-Extension for 64-Bit Destinations**:
  - For 64-bit destinations:
    - **Sign-extension** is supported for all three source types.
    - **Zero-extension** is supported for the two smaller source types (e.g., byte and word).

- **`cltq` Instruction**:
  - **Purpose**: Performs sign-extension of a 32-bit value in `%eax` into the 64-bit `%rax` register.
  - **Compact Encoding**: It has no explicit operands and is equivalent to `movslq %eax, %rax`, but uses a more compact representation.
