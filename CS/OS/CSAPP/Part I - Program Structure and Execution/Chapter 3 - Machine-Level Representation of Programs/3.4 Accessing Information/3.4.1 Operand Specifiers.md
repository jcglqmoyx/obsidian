Most instructions have one or more `operands` specifying the source values to use in performing an operation and the destination location into which to place the result. x86-64 supports a number of operand forms. Source values can be given as constants or read from registers or memory. Results can be stored in either registers or memory. Thus, the different operand possibilities can be classified into three types. The first type, `immediate`, is for constant values. In ATT- format assembly code, these are written with a ‘$’ followed by an integer using standard C notation—for example, $\$-577$ or $\$0x1F$. Different instructions allow different ranges of immediate values; the assembler will automatically select the most compact way of encoding a value. The second type, `register`, denotes the contents of a register, one of the sixteen 8-, 4-, 2-, or 1-byte low-order portions of the registers for operands having 64, 32, 16, or 8 bits, respectively. We use the notation ra to denote an arbitrary register a and indicate its value with the reference $R[ra]$, viewing the set of registers as an array `R` indexed by register identifiers.

The third type of operand is a `memory` reference, in which we access some memory location according to a computed address, often called the `effective address`. Since we view the memory as a large array of bytes, we use the notation $Mb[Addr]$ to denote a reference to the b-byte value stored in memory starting at address `Addr`. To simplify things, we will generally drop the subscript `b`.

There are many different `addressing` modes allowing different forms of memory references. The most general form is shown at the bottom of the table with syntax $Imm(r_b,r_i,s)$. Such a reference has four components: an immediate offset `Imm`, a base register $r_b$, an index register $r_i$, and a scale factor $s$, where s must be 1, 2, 4, or 8. Both the base and index must be 64-bit registers. The effective address is computed as $Imm + R[r_b] + R[r_i]$ . s. This general form is often seen when referencing elements of arrays. The other forms are simply special cases of this general form where some of the components are omitted. The more complex addressing modes are useful when referencing array and structure elements.


### Practice Problem 3.1

Assume the following values are stored at the indicated memory addresses and registers:

| Address | Value | Register | Value  |
|---------|-------|----------|--------|
| 0x100   | 0xFF  | %rax     | 0x100  |
| 0x104   | 0xAB  | %rcx     | 0x1    |
| 0x108   | 0x13  | %rdx     | 0x3    |
| 0x10C   | 0x11  |          |        |

#### Fill in the following table showing the values for the indicated operands:

| Operand             | Value | Comment            |
|---------------------|-------|--------------------|
| %rax                | 0x100 | Register           |
| 0x104               | 0xAB  | Absolute address   |
| $0x108              | 0x108 | Immediate          |
| (%rax)              | 0xFF  | Address 0x100      |
| 4(%rax)             | 0xAB  | Address 0x104      |
| 9(%rax,%rdx)        | 0x11  | Address 0x10C      |
| 260(%rcx,%rdx)      | 0x13  | Address 0x108      |
| 0xFC(,%rcx,4)       | 0xFF  | Address 0x100      |
| (%rax,%rdx,4)       | 0x11  | Address 0x10C      |
