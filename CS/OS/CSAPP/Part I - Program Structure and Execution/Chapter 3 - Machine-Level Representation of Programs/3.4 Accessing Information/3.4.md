An x86-64 central processing unit (CPU) contains a set of 16 `general-purpose registers` storing 64-bit values. These registers are used to store integer data as well as pointers.


|        | 64-bit | 32-bit  | 16-bit  | 8-bit   |               |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------------- |

| `%rcx` | `%rcx` | `%ecx`  | `%cx`   | `%cl`   | 4th argument  |
| `%rdx` | `%rdx` | `%edx`  | `%dx`   | `%dl`   | 3rd argument  |
| `%rsi` | `%rsi` | `%esi`  | `%si`   | `%sil`  | 2nd argument  |
| `%rdi` | `%rdi` | `%edi`  | `%di`   | `%dil`  | 1st argument  |
| `%rbp` | `%rbp` | `%ebp`  | `%bp`   | `%bpl`  | Callee saved  |
| `%rsp` | `%rsp` | `%esp`  | `%sp`   | `%spl`  | Stack pointer |

| `%r12` | `%r12` | `%r12d` | `%r12w` | `%r12b` | Callee saved  |
| `%r13` | `%r13` | `%r13d` | `%r13w` | `%r13b` | Callee saved  |
| `%r14` | `%r14` | `%r14d` | `%r14w` | `%r14b` | Callee saved  |
| `%r15` | `%r15` | `%r15d` | `%r15w` | `%r15b` | Callee saved  |

As the annotations along the right-hand side of Figure 3.2 indicate, different registers serve different roles in typical programs. Most unique among them is the stack pointer, `%rsp`, used to indicate the end position in the run-time stack. Some instructions specifically read and write this register. The other 15 registers have more flexibility in their uses. A small number of instructions make specific use of certain registers. More importantly, a set of standard programming conventions governs how the registers are to be used for managing the stack, passing function arguments, returning values from functions, and storing local and temporary data.
