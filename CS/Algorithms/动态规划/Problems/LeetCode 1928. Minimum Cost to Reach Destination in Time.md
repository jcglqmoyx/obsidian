There is a country of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` where **all the cities are connected** by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [xi, yi, timei]` denotes a road between cities `xi` and `yi` that takes `timei` minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.

Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a **0-indexed** integer array `passingFees` of length `n` where `passingFees[j]` is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city `j`.

In the beginning, you are at city `0` and want to reach city `n - 1` in `maxTime` **minutes or less**. The **cost** of your journey is the **summation of passing fees** for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (**including** the source and destination cities).

Given `maxTime`, `edges`, and `passingFees`, return *the **minimum cost** to complete your journey, or* `-1` *if you cannot complete it within* `maxTime` *minutes*.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/leetgraph1-1.png)

**Input:** maxTime = 30, edges = \[\[0,1,10\],\[1,2,10\],\[2,5,10\],\[0,3,1\],\[3,4,10\],\[4,5,15\]\], passingFees = \[5,1,2,20,20,3\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The path to take is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5, which takes 30 minutes and has $11 worth of passing fees.

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/copy-of-leetgraph1-1.png)**

**Input:** maxTime = 29, edges = \[\[0,1,10\],\[1,2,10\],\[2,5,10\],\[0,3,1\],\[3,4,10\],\[4,5,15\]\], passingFees = \[5,1,2,20,20,3\]
**Output:** 48
**Explanation:** The path to take is 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which takes 26 minutes and has $48 worth of passing fees.
You cannot take path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 since it would take too long.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** maxTime = 25, edges = \[\[0,1,10\],\[1,2,10\],\[2,5,10\],\[0,3,1\],\[3,4,10\],\[4,5,15\]\], passingFees = \[5,1,2,20,20,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no way to reach city 5 from city 0 within 25 minutes.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= maxTime <= 1000`
-   `n == passingFees.length`
-   `2 <= n <= 1000`
-   `n - 1 <= edges.length <= 1000`
-   `0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1`
-   `1 <= timei <= 1000`
-   `1 <= passingFees[j] <= 1000`Â 
-   The graph may contain multiple edges between two nodes.
-   The graph does not contain self loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>  
  
using namespace std;  
  
class Solution {  
public:  
    int minCost(int maxTime, vector<vector<int>> &edges, vector<int> &passingFees) {  
        auto n = passingFees.size();  
        // f[i][j]: the minimum cost to reach city j within time i  
        int f[maxTime + 1][n];  
        memset(f, 0x3f, sizeof f);  
        f[0][0] = passingFees[0];  
        for (int i = 1; i <= maxTime; i++) {  
            for (auto &e: edges) {  
                int x = e[0], y = e[1], z = e[2];  
                if (i >= z) {  
                    f[i][y] = min(f[i][y], f[i - z][x] + passingFees[y]);  
                    f[i][x] = min(f[i][x], f[i - z][y] + passingFees[x]);  
                }  
            }  
        }  
        int res = 1e9;  
        for (int i = 1; i <= maxTime; i++) {  
            res = min(res, f[i][n - 1]);  
        }  
        return res >= 1e9 ? -1 : res;  
    }  
};
```
